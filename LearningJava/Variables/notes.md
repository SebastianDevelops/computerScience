## Data Types

### Primitive Data Types

There are eight primitive data types in Java.
Primitive Data Types are predefined data types which serves as building blocks.

Type | Size | Value
------ | ------|----------
Boolean|1 Bit| true or false
Int|4 Bytes|-2 billion to 2 billion
Byte|1 Byte|-128 to 127
Char|2 Bytes| Single Chacter/ Letter or ASCII value
Long|8 Bytes| -9 quintillion to 9 quintillion
Float|4 Bytes| Fractional number up to 6-7 digits
Double|8 Bytes| Fractional number up to 15 digits
Short|2 Bytes| -32 768 to 32 767  


### Reference Data Type

Reference types refers to objects that are created by the programmer, not predefined in Java. Reference types hold the  referance of objects.

Type | Size | Description
------ | ------|----------
String|Varies| A string is a sequence of characters
Class|Varies|Describes the content of am object
Array|Varies | Fixed data structure that stores element of the same type
Annotations|Varies| Association of metatdata with program elements
Interface|Varies| Abstract type used to spcify behavior of a class
Enumeration|Varies| Class that represents a group of constants

### Primitive vs reference

Primitive| Reference
-----------|----------
Predefined | User defined
Stores data | Stores and address
Can only hold one value | Could hold more than one value
less memory | more memory
faster | slower

#### Keywords
- constant(immutable): **Variable that can not change value once assigned.**
- Abstract Type: **Restricted class that cannot be used to create objects.**
