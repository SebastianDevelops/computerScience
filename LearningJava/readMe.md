## The first step 
---
The first step required in my journey to learning computer science as a self taught developer is to choose a programming language that I'm comfortable with. I'm already an experienced developer in C# but I wanted to choose a language from the **top three famous languages**. One of these happen to be Java.

I will be learning the **basics of Java from scratch** such as variables, loops, methods, classes etc.
I understand that Java and C# have a very similar syntax so this will not be much of a challenge.
